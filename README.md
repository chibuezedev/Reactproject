<p> The MongoDB Netflix Clone implements many Atlas Search features from autocomplete to custom function scoring. Using the $search operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, we can build fine-grained searches across text, numerics, and geospatial data. By building out this application, you'll learn all sorts of ways MongoDB allows you to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches on your Atlas data.</p>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**

Current features implemented in this Movie Search Engine demo application include:

- fuzzy matching
- highlighting
- autocomplete
- relevance-based scoring
- custom function scoring

Future Atlas Search features to implement can include:

- [ ] facets
- [ ] synonyms
